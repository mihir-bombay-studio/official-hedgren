But there is always a choice to move forward. \n<br><br>\n‘I believe there is a fire in everyone, the more you move, the bigger it gets’. \nThere are many reasons why Stefanos is one of our Hedgrenists, his free-spirited nature is just one of them.",

Yep, that’s one of Dieter’s. \n<br><br>\nLeave it to him to come up with Europe’s biggest Instagram and TikTok museum. Wacky ideas that bring smiles to people’s faces is what this guy from Antwerp excels at. In fact, it’s his core business. Aside from all the fun stuff we already mentioned, he and his team also came up with CityCubes, HAPPI and de Serre. And there’s bound to be lots more to come. \n<br><br>\nDoing all this while juggling a busy schedule, raising a child and writing a book? Some people seem to have a capacity to multitask equivalent to an octopus’ natural ability to simultaneously play all the keys on a grand piano. Only, bringing Dieter in on your next event will actually strike a chord an eight-limned mollusk can only dream about.

Whether the object of their attention is family, nature or work, their focus is always on the bigger picture. To them, life is an adventure worth living to the max. It presents an abundance of opportunities to those willing to see the world in terms of its potential. \n<br><br>\nSo reliability and smart functionality is key to navigating from A to B.
